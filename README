== A bootstrap (and some more) for IA32 computers.

I've created this to help my students. That's why I won't accept pull requests. (need to keep it plain simple)

OS Implementation is not for the faint of heart. Good luck folks.

Included:

- Bootstrap
- A20 gate handling
- 32 bits Protected Mode 
- GDT setup
